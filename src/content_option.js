    aboutme: "Heyy, I 'm VishwaRaviraaj, a programmer with a love for all things code. I speak fluent Java, and Python, but my real passion is for writing clean and efficient code that would make any computer proud. When I'm not coding, you can find me debugging in my sleep, chasing down bugs and errors. I'm also a self-proclaimed expert in procrastination, spending hours on Stack Overflow looking for answers to problems I haven't even encountered yet.  I firmly believe that programming is a form of art, with the code as the canvas and the algorithms as the paintbrush. And like any artist, I'm always looking to push the boundaries of what's possible, experimenting with new technologies and frameworks in my quest to create the perfect program. Overall, I'm a programmer with a passion for all things code, and I'm always up for a challenge. So, if you need someone to write clean, efficient, and occasionally logic-filled code, look no further!"
